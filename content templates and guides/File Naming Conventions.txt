The naming convention should be pretty obvious.
T = tutorial
W = workout
H = Help module
C = challenge module

Inside a module:
S00 – About = the description page for a set
S01P01 = set 1, page 1
S01P02 = set 1, page 2
SnPm – About  = the description page for set n, page m
S01P01 – V01 –=  the first video for set 1, page 1
S02P04 – I04 = the 4th image to be attached to page4 of set 2

File Sort Order within a Module
The names have been chosen so when you view the files for a module in a Windows Explorer window (or a Mac Finder) window, the Page  files sort in the same order as  they would be displayed to a player. The Set file for S01 comes first, then the Pages within the S01 set, followed by the S02 Set items, etc.
